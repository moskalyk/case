# Case
Design for the person your user wants to be

# axios vs. fetch

```js
const axios = require('axios');

let url = 'localhost:5880/user?ID=12345'
// Make a request for a user with a given ID
let axiosPromise = axios.get(url)

// vs. native browser code
let promise = fetch(url)
```

# random ideas
- use of mixins
- swapable databases (e.g. i use google maps for businesses because they have education certificates, but i use apple typically for nav becuase they have trees on their map)
